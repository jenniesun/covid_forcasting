## Objective:
Leveraging ML to forcast State (and county/region) level COVID-19 cases and deaths. 

## Data: 
### Main: Open-Access Data and Computational Resources to Address COVID-19(https://datascience.nih.gov/covid-19-open-access-resources)

### Supplementary: Data Behind the Dashboards | NC COVID-19 (https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/data-behind-dashboards)

Some of the tables used in the analysis:
- State and County level COVID-19 cases & death count
- Hospital beds
- Wastewater monitoring 


Timeline: 
Week 1: Data aquisition, EDA

Week 2: Feature engineering, model selection

Week 3: Model evaluation, reporting on Jupyter Notebook
