## Objective:
Leveraging ML to forecast region level COVID-19 deaths. 
Region of interest: Duke Healthcare Preparedness Coalition (DHPC)

## Unit of Analysis: 
- Number of COVID-19 deaths in DHPC / week

## Data:
Main: 

Open-Access Data and Computational Resources to Address COVID-19 (https://datascience.nih.gov/covid-19-open-access-resources)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) data lake for analysis of COVID-19 data

Supplementary: 

Data Behind the Dashboards | NC COVID-19 (https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/data-behind-dashboards)

Tables used in the analysis:
- COVID-19 cases & death count
- Hospital Beds and Ventilators
- Hospital Metrics by Region
